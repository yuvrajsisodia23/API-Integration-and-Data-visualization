# Description
Introduction
This project is developed as part of the CodTech Internship Program Task 1. The goal of this task is to explore real-time data integration using publicly available APIs and transform the data into insightful visualizations. This README aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the project, its components, and a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution.
The API selected for this task is the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides weather forecasting data for any city around the world. Using Python, the data is fetched, processed, and then visualized using two of the most widely-used libraries: Matplotlib and Seaborn.
This project is essential to understanding the real-world application of APIs, data handling, and visualization â€” all of which are crucial skills for any data analyst, data scientist, or software developer.
Objective
The primary objective of this project is to:

Integrate a public API using Python.
Fetch real-time data and parse JSON responses.
Process and clean the data to make it suitable for visualization.
Use visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create meaningful graphs.
Present insights in a readable and understandable format.

Tools and Libraries Used

Python 3.10+: Programming language used for the entire project.
requests: For sending HTTP requests to the API.
json: For handling JSON data responses.
matplotlib: For plotting basic graphs.
seaborn: For creating aesthetically pleasing visualizations.
datetime: For managing and converting date-time strings.

Why OpenWeatherMap API?
The OpenWeatherMap API is a robust, free, and beginner-friendly weather API that provides access to weather conditions, forecasts, and historical data. It allows fetching detailed forecast data for 5 days with 3-hour intervals, which is perfect for this visualization task.
Some key advantages:

Freely accessible with a simple registration.
Supports various data formats like JSON and XML.
Real-time and forecast weather data.
Easy-to-use endpoints.

Setup Instructions

Clone or download the repository.
Install the required libraries using pip:
pip install requests matplotlib seaborn


Get your free API key from OpenWeatherMap.
Open the Python script and replace "your_api_key_here" with your actual API key.
Run the script:
python weather_dashboard.py
